# learnJS 📚

A comprehensive repository documenting my journey through JavaScript, from fundamentals to advanced concepts. This repository serves as both a learning log and a resource for core JS principles.

## 🗂️ Curriculum

The repository is organized into sequential modules:

- **01_Basics**: Variables, Datatypes, Type Conversion, and Basic Operations.
- **02_Basics**: Objects, Arrays, and Functions.
- **03_Basics**: Scope, Hoisting, Arrow Functions, and the `this` keyword.
- **04_ControlFlow**: If-else, Switch, Truthy/Falsy values.
- **05_Iterations**: Loops (for, while, do-while) and High-Order Array Loops (forEach, map, filter, reduce).
- **06_DOM**: Document Object Model manipulation, Selectors, and Nodes.
- **07_Events**: Event Listeners, Bubbling, Capturing, and Event Delegation.

## 🚀 How to Use

Each directory contains `index.js` files or relevant scripts demonstrating specific concepts. You can run any file using Node.js:

```bash
node 01_basics/variables.js
```

Or open the HTML files in the `06_dom` and `07_events` folders to see the concepts in action in the browser.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Language**: JavaScript (ECMAScript 6+)
- **Environment**: Node.js & Browser Console

## 📖 Key Takeaways

- Deep understanding of JS Memory Management (Stack vs Heap).
- Mastery of Asynchronous JS and Promises.
- DOM Manipulation and Event Handling best practices.
- Functional programming patterns (Map, Filter, Reduce).
